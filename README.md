Tomato Timer is a user-friendly and enhanced version of a time-management tool inspired by the Pomodoro Technique. Originally a course project from the [100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/) by Dr. Angela Yu, this version includes several custom changes and additional features for a more engaging experience.

Built with Python and Tkinter, Tomato Timer is packaged using ```PyInstaller```, allowing it to run conveniently as a standalone program on your desktop.

## Features

- **Work and Break Cycles:** Tomato Timer follows the basic structure of the Pomodoro technique with 25-minute work sessions, 5-minute short breaks, and a 20-minute long break after every 4 work sessions.

- **Visual Timer:** A dynamic display shows the time remaining during work or break sessions with large, clear numbers for easy tracking.

- **Session Count:** After each completed work session, a âœ” mark is added to track your progress.

### Enhanced Features

- **Audio Alerts:** Notification sounds play at the start of each work or break session (requires ```Pygame``` for sound functionality).
- **Enhanced Button Control:** The 'Start' button is disabled once clicked, preventing multiple clicks and ensuring the timer runs smoothly.
- **Styled Buttons:** Added support for ```ttk``` to introduce visually appealing, styled buttons with hover effects.
- **Custom Styling:** The user interface has been visually enhanced with unique fonts and vibrant colors to create a user-friendly experience.
- **Custom Graphics:** Designed a custom tomato graphic and icon to replace the default image, making the display more playful and engaging.
- **Convenient Packaging:** Packaged the program using ```PyInstaller``` to make it easy to launch directly from a desktop shortcut, without needing to manually run the Python script.
